This project aims to build the game 'Mastermind' from the command line.

The player gets to choose to be either the codemaker or the codebreaker. 
12 turns are used to determine a win/loss for the npc or player.
As a guesser, a win is obtained when the secret code is broken within 12 guesses.
As a code maker, a win is obtained when the npc is unable to guess your code in 12 guesses.
